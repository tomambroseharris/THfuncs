# THfuncs

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of THfuncs is to hold functions that I have created

## Installation

You can install the development version of THfuncs like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```
S
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(THfuncs)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
