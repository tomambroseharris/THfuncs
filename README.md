# THfuncs

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of THfuncs is to hold functions that I have created.

The first function is a summary percentages function, produced
originally for equalities analysis in the Higher Education Analysis
team. The function summarises wide data by give protected groups and
characteristics, taking account of unknown values (NAs) and different
sample sets.

## Installation

You can install the development version of THfuncs like so:

``` r
library(devtools)

devtools::install_github("tomambroseharris/THfuncs", force = TRUE)

library(THfuncs)

?prop_in_group()
```
